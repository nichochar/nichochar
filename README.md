Bonjour ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Nick, and I like to build stuff. I'm a generalist developer, I've worked all across the stack and in many languages, but I keep coming back to my two favorites: TypeScript and Elixir.

I'm currently working on [Srcbook](https://github.com/srcbookdev/srcbook): a TypeScript notebook. It's open-source and powered by node, you should check it out!

```bash
npx srcook@latest start
```

Previously I've worked at Cruise, Pinterest, URX and other startups.
