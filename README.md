Bonjour ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Nick, and I like to build stuff. I'm a generalist developer, I've worked all across the stack and in many languages, but I keep coming back to my favorite 2: TypeScript and Elixir.

I'm currently working on [Srcbook](https://github.com/srcbookdev/srcbook), a TypeScript notebook. It's open-source and powered by node, you should check it out! Simply run `npx srcook@latest start` to get started.

Previously, I've worked at Cruise, Pinterest, URX and other startups. I love building products and making things that others use.
